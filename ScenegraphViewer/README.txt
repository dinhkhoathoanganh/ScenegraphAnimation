Scene Overview
##############################################################################
The scenery includes a grass ground, a water body, two buildings, a light house, a shining moon, a humanoid and a camera drone. 
The humanoid is raising his arm, to welcome us to visit his town.
The first building has a rectangular shape with five stories. Each story has either a wooden window, or a see-through window. The second building has a prism-like shape with three stories. Each story has either a glass window or a see-through window. 
The camera drone can be controlled and move around the scene, with rotating blades on top of each propeller to have the realistic view of the drone flying. The drone further has a red cylindrical camera and a stand to hold the light.
The light house has a roof and a bricked body, with a yellow spot light rotating around 360 degrees.
The screen can be seen in the perspective of world view or camera view. The world view is the perspective view from a stationary point above the ground to see every object in the scene. The camera view is the perspective view from the camera of the flying drone.
